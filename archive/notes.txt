TensorFlow.js replaced deeplearn.js

- Better performance with the Python(Tensorflow Version)

- Better to use the Python version if you're server based

- Javascript better if using the browser 

- Machine Learning is the ability to learn without explicit programming 

Whereas most pc(s) is accustomed to:

  2 x 5  =   10
  input    output 

Machine learning adds (models) in between input and output:
  input -> Learning Model -> output 


input (What is the biggest dessert in the world?) -> LModel (Learns from the input: in this case infers desert
    instead of dessert) -> output (Sahara Desert)


Machines need to be trained in order for its model to be accurate: Lots of data made AlphaGo better at Go than its
champion.
